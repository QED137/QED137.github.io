        <h1>A Template for Life</h1>
        <p>Once, a wise person said that life is like a complex number—it has both real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part is the broader understanding of life as a social animal, our position within society, and how we navigate the world with purpose and meaning. The real part is about dealing with the day-to-day tasks—whether it’s making a living, working, or pursuing something greater, like fine arts or personal projects.

For the imaginary part of life, I draw inspiration from great thinkers like Stephen Hawking. His motto, “No matter how difficult life is, there is always a way,” reminds me that challenges, no matter how insurmountable, always have a solution if you look for it. Similarly, I resonate deeply with Einstein’s perspective on life: “There are two ways of living: One is as though nothing is a miracle, the other is as though everything is.” I choose to see life as a miracle, where every moment and discovery has the potential to inspire wonder and drive personal growth.

As for the real part of life, I find clarity in my approach through the wisdom of George Polya. His advice, “If you can't solve a problem, then there is an easier problem you can solve: find it,” has shaped the way I tackle challenges. This mindset helps me break down complex issues into smaller, manageable steps, making progress feel more attainable and less overwhelming. It’s not always about solving the hardest problem; it’s about finding the right problem to solve first.

Lastly, I’m constantly motivated by Richard Feynman’s words, which he once read in a Buddhist temple: “If anyone has done that, any fool can do this.” This simple yet powerful statement inspires me to learn anything that comes my way, reinforcing the idea that knowledge and achievement are accessible to all with the right mindset and dedication.</p>
